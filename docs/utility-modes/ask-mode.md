# ❓ Ask Mode

**Available anytime during your journey**

Have a question? Confused about a concept? Want something explained differently? Ask mode is your always-available learning companion.

## Purpose

In Ask mode, 1M Code acts as a **patient teacher**. It will:

- Answer questions in plain language
- Explain concepts without jargon
- Use diagrams and examples
- Never make you feel dumb for asking

## When to Use This Mode

Use Ask mode when:

- You don't understand something
- You want a concept explained differently
- You're curious about how something works
- You want to learn without doing

## Available Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `read` | Read files to understand your project |
| `browser` | Research topics and find resources |

Note: Ask mode has **limited tools**. It focuses on explaining, not doing.

## Example Prompts

### Understanding Concepts

```
What is an API? Explain it like I'm 5.
```

```
What's the difference between frontend and backend?
```

```
Why do I need a database? Can't I just save things in files?
```

### Code Explanations

```
What does this line of code do?
```const [count, setCount] = useState(0);```
```

```
I keep seeing 'async/await' in code. What does it mean?
```

### Project Questions

```
Why did you structure the project this way?
```

```
What's the difference between pages and components in Next.js?
```

### Learning More

```
What should I learn next after finishing this project?
```

```
What's React and why does everyone use it?
```

## How Ask Mode Differs

Unlike Build or Ship mode, Ask mode:

- **Doesn't make changes** — It explains, not modifies
- **Focuses on understanding** — Takes time to explain concepts
- **Uses analogies** — Relates technical concepts to everyday things
- **Encourages questions** — Never judges you for not knowing

## The "ELI5" Approach

1M Code in Ask mode follows the "Explain Like I'm 5" philosophy:

**Bad explanation:**
> "React uses a virtual DOM diffing algorithm to reconcile state changes and optimize re-renders through fiber reconciliation."

**Good explanation:**
> "React is like a smart assistant that remembers what your webpage looks like. When something changes, instead of rebuilding the whole page, it only updates the parts that actually changed. This makes your app faster."

## Common Questions

### About Coding

**Q: Do I need to understand all the code?**
A: No. Focus on what it does, not how it works. Understanding comes with time.

**Q: What if I don't understand the explanation?**
A: Say "I still don't get it, can you explain differently?" 1M Code will try again.

**Q: Is it okay to ask basic questions?**
A: Absolutely. There are no dumb questions. Everyone starts somewhere.

### About Learning

**Q: How long does it take to "learn to code"?**
A: You're already learning by building. The goal isn't to "know everything"—it's to be able to build things you want.

**Q: Should I take a course first?**
A: Building is the course. Learn as you go. When you need to understand something, ask.

**Q: What's the best way to remember things?**
A: Use them. You'll forget concepts you read about but remember things you build.

## Switching to Ask Mode

When you have a question, switch to Ask mode:

**Slash command:** `/ask`

**Or just say:** "I don't understand X, can you explain?"

You can switch to Ask mode at any point in your journey and switch back when you're ready to continue building.

## When to Switch Back

Return to your previous mode when:

- You understand the concept
- You're ready to continue working
- Your question has been answered

There's no shame in spending time in Ask mode. Understanding makes building easier.
