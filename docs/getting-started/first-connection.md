# Connecting to OneMillion

To use OneMillion Code's AI features, you need to connect your OneMillion account. This is what gives you **free access** to powerful AI models—no API keys or credit cards required.

## Why Do I Need an Account?

OneMillion provides free AI access through donated API credits from Anthropic and Google. Your account:

- **Identifies you** as an enrolled builder
- **Tracks your usage** to ensure fair access for everyone
- **Enables your Builder Number** when you ship your first product
- **Connects you** to your Crew and Captain

## Connection Steps

### Step 1: Open OneMillion Code

Click the Builder Blocks icon in the Activity Bar to open the OneMillion Code panel.

### Step 2: Click "Get Started" or "Connect to OneMillion"

On the welcome screen, you'll see a button to connect your account. Click it.

### Step 3: Sign In via Browser

A browser window will open to the OneMillion sign-in page. You can sign in using:

- **Email** — Enter your email and we'll send a sign-in link
- **GitHub** — One-click sign-in with your GitHub account

:::tip First Time?
If you don't have a OneMillion account yet, you can create one during this process. It only takes a minute.

### Step 4: Authorize the Connection

After signing in, you'll see a confirmation page. Click **"Authorize"** to connect your account to the extension.

### Step 5: Return to VS Code

The browser will redirect you back to VS Code automatically. If it doesn't:

1. Copy the authorization URL from the browser
2. Return to VS Code manually
3. If prompted, paste the URL

### Step 6: You're Connected!

You'll see a success message in OneMillion Code. The welcome screen will update to show:

- Your account information
- Your cohort (if enrolled in an active Ship Cycle)
- Your Builder Number (if you've shipped a product)

## What Happens After Connection?

Once connected, you can:

- **Start chatting** with 1M Code immediately
- **Switch between modes** to match your current task
- **Build your product** with free AI assistance

Your session stays active across VS Code restarts. You'll only need to sign in again if:
- You explicitly sign out
- Your session expires (rare)
- You switch to a different computer

## Account Types

| Type | Who | Access |
|------|-----|--------|
| **Enrolled** | Active cohort member | Full AI access, standard limits |
| **Builder** | Shipped a product | Full AI access, higher limits |
| **Captain** | Alumni mentor | Full access + cohort visibility |

Most builders start as **Enrolled** and upgrade to **Builder** status when they ship their first product.

## Usage Limits

To ensure everyone gets fair access to free AI:

| Limit | Amount |
|-------|--------|
| Requests per minute | 10 |
| Requests per hour | 100 |
| Tokens per day | 100,000 |

These limits are generous enough for active building. If you hit a limit, wait a few minutes and try again.

## Troubleshooting

### Browser Didn't Open?

1. Click the sign-in button again
2. If still not working, check if your browser allows pop-ups from VS Code
3. Try copying the sign-in URL manually

### Authorization Failed?

1. Make sure you're signed into the correct OneMillion account
2. Try signing out and signing in again
3. Clear your browser cookies and try again

### Connection Not Working?

1. Check your internet connection
2. Reload VS Code (`Ctrl + Shift + P` → "Reload Window")
3. Try the connection process again
