# 📣 Step 8: Sell Mode

**Days 16-17 of your journey**

Your product is live. Now it needs users. Sell mode helps you create a landing page, tell your story, and get your first customers.

## Purpose

In Sell mode, 1M Code acts as a **growth marketer**. It will:

- Help you create a compelling landing page
- Craft your value proposition
- Suggest channels for finding users
- Guide you toward first revenue (if applicable)

## When to Use This Mode

Use Sell mode when:

- Your product is deployed and working
- You need a landing page
- You want to find your first users
- You're ready to tell the world

## Available Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `read` | Review existing content |
| `edit` | Create landing pages and copy |
| `browser` | Research marketing channels |
| `command` | Deploy landing page updates |

## Example Prompts

### Creating a Landing Page

```
Help me create a landing page for my water reminder app. 
I want to explain what it does and get people to try it.
```

### Writing Copy

```
Write a headline and tagline for my water reminder app. 
The target audience is college students.
```

### Finding Users

```
Where should I post about my water reminder app to find my first users?
```

### Getting Feedback

```
I want to collect feedback from early users. 
What's the simplest way to do this?
```

## The Landing Page

Your landing page needs to answer three questions in seconds:

### 1. What is it?
A clear headline that explains the product.

> "Never forget to drink water again."

### 2. Why should I care?
The benefit to the user.

> "Simple reminders that keep you hydrated during study sessions."

### 3. What do I do next?
A clear call to action.

## Finding Your First Users

### Where to Post

| Platform | Best For | Tips |
|----------|----------|------|
| **Reddit** | Specific communities | Find your niche subreddit, provide value first |
| **Twitter/X** | Tech audience | Share your building journey, use relevant hashtags |
| **LinkedIn** | Professional network | Tell your story, celebrate shipping |
| **ProductHunt** | New products | Good for launch day visibility |
| **Indie Hackers** | Maker community | Share your journey and learnings |
| **Friends & Family** | First feedback | Ask them to try it and give honest feedback |

### The 10-User Challenge

Your goal: Get **10 real users** who aren't friends or family.

These 10 users will tell you:
- If your product actually solves a problem
- What's confusing or broken
- Whether they'd use it again

10 users is a small number, but it's harder than you think. If you can get 10 strangers to use your product, you've built something real.

## What to Post

### The Building Journey Post

```
Just shipped my first product! 🚀

I built [product name] in 2.5 weeks as part of @OneMillion.

It helps [target user] by [solving problem].

Here's the link: [URL]

Would love feedback from anyone who [fits target user].

#buildinpublic #indiehacker
```

### The Problem/Solution Post

```
Ever forget to drink water during long study sessions? 

I built a simple reminder app that nudges you to hydrate.

No account needed. No fancy features. Just works.

Try it: [URL]
```

### The Ask for Feedback Post

```
Looking for 10 beta testers!

I built [product name] and need honest feedback before I add more features.

Takes 2 minutes to try.

Link: [URL]

What's working? What's confusing? DM me or comment below.
```

## Collecting Feedback

### Simple Feedback Methods

1. **Google Form** — Create a short survey
2. **Email link** — "Email me at..."
3. **Twitter DMs** — "DM me your thoughts"
4. **In-app feedback** — Simple "Send Feedback" button

### Questions to Ask

- What's confusing about the app?
- What would make you use this every day?
- Would you recommend this to a friend?
- What features are missing?

## First Revenue (Optional)

If your product could charge money:

### Simple Payment Options
- **Stripe** — For one-time or subscription payments
- **Gumroad** — For simple digital product sales
- **Buy Me a Coffee** — For tips/donations

### When to Charge
- After you've validated the product works
- When you have happy users asking for more features
- When you can offer a premium version

For MVP, **free is fine**. Get users first, monetize later.

## Output of This Phase

By the end of Sell mode, you should have:

1. **Landing page** — Explains your product clearly
2. **10+ users** — Real people using your product
3. **Feedback** — Insights for improvement
4. **Public presence** — At least one post about your product

## You Did It

You started with an idea. Now you have:

- ✅ A product that solves a real problem
- ✅ A live URL anyone can visit
- ✅ Real users giving you feedback
- ✅ The skills to do this again

This is what it means to be a builder.

## What's Next?

### Apply for Your Builder Badge

If you completed this journey as part of a OneMillion cohort, your Captain will verify your deployment and you'll receive your **Builder Number**.

### Keep Building

This is just the beginning. You can:
- Improve based on feedback
- Add features users requested
- Build your next product (it'll be easier now)
- Help others learn to build
