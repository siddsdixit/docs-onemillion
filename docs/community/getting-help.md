# Getting Help

Stuck? Confused? Something broken? Here's how to get help.

## Help Hierarchy

Try these in order:

### 1. Ask 1M Code

Switch to ❓ Ask mode or 🪲 Debug mode and describe your problem. 1M Code is available 24/7 and can help with most issues.

**Good for:**
- Understanding concepts
- Debugging code
- Getting unstuck
- Learning how things work

### 2. Check the Docs

Search this documentation site. Use the search bar or browse:
- [Troubleshooting Guide](/reference/troubleshooting)
- [Mode references](/reference/modes-quick-ref)
- [Tips & Tricks](/using-the-extension/tips-and-tricks)

**Good for:**
- Known issues and solutions
- How-to guides
- Feature explanations

### 3. Ask Your Crew

Post in your Crew's Discord channel. Your Crewmates are going through the same journey and may have faced the same issue.

**Good for:**
- Cohort-specific questions
- Quick sanity checks
- Moral support
- Project feedback

### 4. Ask Your Captain

If you've been stuck for 2+ days or it's urgent, reach out to your Captain directly.

**Good for:**
- Blockers affecting your progress
- Questions about the cohort
- Major decisions
- Extended absences

### 5. Community Discord

Post in the general OneMillion Discord channels where alumni and staff can help.

**Good for:**
- Questions beyond your Crew's knowledge
- Technical deep dives
- Community wisdom
- Networking

## Discord Channels

| Channel | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `#general` | Community discussion |
| `#help` | Technical questions |
| `#showcase` | Share your work |
| `#introductions` | New member intros |
| `#jobs` | Opportunities |
| `#your-crew` | Private Crew channel |

## How to Ask Good Questions

Better questions get better answers. Include:

### 1. What You're Trying to Do
> "I'm trying to add a save button that stores data to localStorage."

### 2. What's Happening
> "When I click the button, nothing happens. No errors in console."

### 3. What You've Tried
> "I've checked that the onClick handler is attached. I added a console.log and it doesn't fire."

### 4. Relevant Code/Error
> "Here's my component code: [code block]"

### Example of a Good Question

> **Bad:** "My button doesn't work"
>
> **Good:** "I'm building a notes app. I added a Save button that should store the current note to localStorage. When I click it, nothing happens — no console.log, no storage update. I've confirmed the onClick is attached. Here's my code: [code]. Any ideas what I'm missing?"

## Response Times

| Channel | Typical Response |
|---------|------------------|
| 1M Code | Instant |
| Crew Discord | Hours |
| Captain | 24-48 hours |
| Community Discord | Hours to days |

During active cohorts, response times are faster.
