# The 8-Step Builder Journey

OneMillion Code is built around a proven framework for taking complete beginners from zero to shipped product in **2.5 weeks**. This isn't a course—it's a structured journey that ends with a real product on the internet.

## The Philosophy

Traditional coding education focuses on learning concepts first, building later. OneMillion flips this:

**Ship first. Learn as you go.**

You'll learn by doing. Every concept you encounter will be in service of building your product. By the end, you won't just understand coding—you'll have proof that you can build.

## The Timeline

```
Week 1: THINK & START
├── Days 1-2:  💡 IDEA    - Find your problem
├── Days 2-3:  📝 SPEC    - Define your solution
└── Days 3-4:  🏗️ PLAN    - Design how to build it

Week 2: BUILD & REFINE
├── Days 4-10: 💻 BUILD   - Write the code
├── Days 11-12: 🧪 TEST   - Make sure it works
└── Days 12-13: 🔒 GUARD  - Make sure it's secure

Week 3: SHIP & GROW
├── Days 13-15: 🚀 SHIP   - Deploy to the internet
└── Days 16-17: 📣 SELL   - Get your first users
```

## The 8 Modes

Each step has a corresponding **mode** in OneMillion Code. When you switch modes, the AI adapts its behavior to match your current task.

### Sequential Journey Modes

| # | Mode | Name | Days | What You'll Do |
|---|------|------|------|----------------|
| 1 | 💡 | [**Idea**](/the-journey/step-1-idea) | 1-2 | Find a real problem worth solving |
| 2 | 📝 | [**Spec**](/the-journey/step-2-spec) | 2-3 | Write a clear product definition |
| 3 | 🏗️ | [**Plan**](/the-journey/step-3-plan) | 3-4 | Design architecture and tech stack |
| 4 | 💻 | [**Build**](/the-journey/step-4-build) | 4-12 | Write code, make it work |
| 5 | 🧪 | [**Test**](/the-journey/step-5-test) | 11-12 | QA, fix bugs, ensure quality |
| 6 | 🔒 | [**Guard**](/the-journey/step-6-guard) | 12-13 | Security scan, fix vulnerabilities |
| 7 | 🚀 | [**Ship**](/the-journey/step-7-ship) | 13-15 | Deploy, go live, real URL |
| 8 | 📣 | [**Sell**](/the-journey/step-8-sell) | 16-17 | Landing page, first users, revenue |

### Always-Available Utility Modes

These modes are available anytime you need them:

| Mode | Name | What It's For |
|------|------|---------------|
| ❓ | [**Ask**](/utility-modes/ask-mode) | Questions, learning, explanations |
| 🪲 | [**Debug**](/utility-modes/debug-mode) | Error diagnosis, troubleshooting |
| 🪃 | [**Orchestrator**](/utility-modes/orchestrator-mode) | Auto-delegates to the right mode |

## How Modes Work

Each mode gives 1M Code different:

- **Personality** — How it communicates with you
- **Tools** — What actions it can take
- **Focus** — What it prioritizes in responses

For example:
- In **💡 Idea** mode, 1M Code asks questions and challenges assumptions
- In **💻 Build** mode, 1M Code writes code and creates files
- In **🚀 Ship** mode, 1M Code focuses on deployment and configuration

## Switching Modes

There are several ways to switch modes:

### 1. Dropdown Menu
Click the mode selector to the left of the chat input and choose a mode.

### 2. Slash Commands
Type a slash command at the start of your message:
- `/idea` — Switch to Idea mode
- `/spec` — Switch to Spec mode
- `/plan` — Switch to Plan mode
- `/build` — Switch to Build mode
- `/test` — Switch to Test mode
- `/guard` — Switch to Guard mode
- `/ship` — Switch to Ship mode
- `/sell` — Switch to Sell mode
- `/ask` — Switch to Ask mode
- `/debug` — Switch to Debug mode

### 3. Keyboard Shortcut
| Operating System | Shortcut |
|------------------|----------|
| macOS | `⌘ + .` |
| Windows/Linux | `Ctrl + .` |

Each press cycles to the next mode.

### 4. Accept Suggestions
1M Code will sometimes suggest switching modes when appropriate. Just click to accept.

## The Builder Badge

When you complete the journey and ship your product, you earn your **Builder Number**:

```
Builder #000001
Builder #000042
Builder #001337
...
Builder #1000000
```

This number is permanent. It's proof that you shipped something real. It's your badge of honor.

## What Makes This Different

### No Scope Creep
Each mode actively guards against doing too much. When you try to add features in Build mode, 1M Code will gently redirect you to finish what you started first.

### Beginner-First
1M Code explains things in plain language. It knows you might be new to coding and adjusts accordingly. No jargon unless you ask for it.

### Progress Over Perfection
The goal is to ship, not to build the perfect product. You can always improve later. Version 1 just needs to work.

### Real Accountability
With Crew and Captain support, you have people counting on you to ship. This isn't self-paced where 90% of people quit—this is a structured cohort with real accountability.

## Ready to Begin?

Start with Step 1: **Idea** mode. Even if you think you already have an idea, going through this process ensures you're building something worth building.
