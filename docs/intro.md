# Welcome to OneMillion Code

**OneMillion Code** is your AI-powered coding assistant designed specifically for the OneMillion builder journey. In just 2.5 weeks, you'll go from zero to shipping a real product—and OneMillion Code will guide you every step of the way.

## What is OneMillion?

OneMillion is a movement to teach one million people to build with AI—**free, forever**. We believe everyone deserves the chance to become a builder, regardless of their technical background or financial situation.

The world is splitting into those who can wield AI and those who can't. We're here to make sure you're on the right side of that divide.

## What is OneMillion Code?

OneMillion Code is a VS Code extension that provides:

- **Free AI Access** — No API keys needed, no monthly fees
- **Guided Modes** — 11 specialized modes that guide you through building
- **The 8-Step Journey** — From idea to shipped product in 2.5 weeks
- **Beginner-Friendly** — Designed for people with zero coding experience

## The 8 Steps to Ship

```
1. 💡 IDEA    →  What problem are you solving?
2. 📝 SPEC    →  What exactly will you build?
3. 🏗️ PLAN    →  How will you build it?
4. 💻 BUILD   →  Write the code
5. 🧪 TEST    →  Make sure it works
6. 🔒 GUARD   →  Make sure it's secure
7. 🚀 SHIP    →  Put it on the internet
8. 📣 SELL    →  Get users & revenue

Stuck? Use ❓ ASK or 🪲 DEBUG anytime
```

Each step has its own **mode** in OneMillion Code. The AI knows exactly what you're trying to accomplish and adapts its help accordingly.

## Who is This For?

OneMillion Code is for **anyone who wants to build**:

- **Complete beginners** with no coding experience
- **Aspiring entrepreneurs** who want to validate ideas quickly
- **Career changers** learning new skills
- **Students** building their first projects
- **Anyone** who has an idea but doesn't know where to start

You don't need to know how to code. You just need to be willing to try.

## How is This Free?

OneMillion has partnerships with AI providers (Anthropic, Google) who donate API credits to support our mission. When you use OneMillion Code:

1. You sign in with your OneMillion account
2. Your requests go through OneMillion's servers
3. We use our donated credits to power your AI interactions
4. You build amazing things—for free

There are usage limits to ensure everyone gets a fair share, but they're generous enough for you to complete your project.

## The Million Starts With One

You are about to become one of the builders who shipped. Not someone who "learned to code" but never built anything. Not someone who took courses but never finished. Not someone who had ideas but never executed.

**A builder.**

Builder #000001 was the first. Someday soon, you'll have your number too.

Let's get started.
