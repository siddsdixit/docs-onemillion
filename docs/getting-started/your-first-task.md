# Your First Task

You've installed OneMillion Code and connected your account. Now let's see it in action by completing your first task.

## Understanding the Interface

When you open OneMillion Code, you'll see:

1. **Mode Selector** — Shows the current mode (starts in 💡 Idea mode)
2. **Chat Input** — Where you type your messages
3. **Conversation Area** — Where responses appear
4. **Toolbar** — Settings, modes, and other options

## Your First Message

Let's start simple. In the chat input, type:

```
Hi! I'm new here. What can you help me build?
```

Press **Enter** (or click the send button) to send your message.

### What Happens Next

1M Code will respond with a friendly welcome and ask about your interests. This is the start of the **Idea** mode—helping you figure out what to build.

## Understanding Modes

Notice the mode indicator shows **💡 Idea**. This tells 1M Code you're in the early stages of your project, looking for problems to solve.

Each mode changes how 1M Code behaves:

| Mode | What 1M Code Does |
|------|-------------------|
| 💡 Idea | Helps you find problems and validate ideas |
| 📝 Spec | Helps you define features and scope |
| 🏗️ Plan | Helps you design architecture |
| 💻 Build | Writes code and implements features |
| 🧪 Test | Helps you test and find bugs |
| 🔒 Guard | Scans for security issues |
| 🚀 Ship | Helps you deploy to production |
| 📣 Sell | Helps with marketing and user acquisition |

You don't need to switch modes manually right now—just be aware they exist.

## Try a Real Prompt

Now let's try something more substantial. Type:

```
I want to build a simple todo list app. What questions should I ask myself before starting?
```

1M Code will walk you through important questions like:
- Who is this for?
- What problem does it solve?
- What's the simplest version that could work?

This is the Idea mode in action—guiding you to think before you build.

## The Approval System

Sometimes 1M Code will ask for your approval before taking action. You'll see buttons like:

- **Approve** — Let 1M Code proceed
- **Reject** — Stop and discuss alternatives
- **Edit** — Modify the suggested action

This keeps you in control. 1M Code won't make changes without your permission.

## Key Concepts

### Ask vs. Do

1M Code can either:
- **Answer questions** — Explain concepts, give advice, help you think
- **Take actions** — Write code, create files, run commands

In early modes (Idea, Spec), it focuses more on questions. In later modes (Build, Ship), it takes more actions.

### Context Matters

1M Code remembers your conversation. You can say things like:
- "Actually, let's make it for students instead"
- "What did you mean by that?"
- "Can you explain that simpler?"

It understands context and adjusts accordingly.

### Asking for Help

At any point, you can ask:
- "I'm confused, can you explain this differently?"
- "What should I do next?"
- "I'm stuck, help!"

1M Code is designed for beginners. Don't be afraid to ask "dumb" questions—there aren't any.

## Your First Real Conversation

Here's an example conversation to try:

**You:** I have an idea for an app that helps people track their water intake. Is this a good idea?

**1M Code:** Great question! Let me help you validate this idea. First, a few questions...

**You:** I want to keep it really simple. Just logging glasses of water.

**1M Code:** Perfect—simplicity is key! Here's how we could scope this...

**You:** I've never coded before. Can I really build this?

**1M Code:** Absolutely! With AI assistance, you can build this in a few days. Let me show you...

## What's Next?

You've completed your first interaction with OneMillion Code. Here's what to do next:

### If You're in a Cohort

Your Captain will guide you through the structured 2.5-week journey. Follow their instructions and use the modes as directed.

### If You're Exploring

Feel free to continue the conversation! Try:

1. Describe your idea (or let 1M Code help you find one)
2. Switch to **📝 Spec** mode when you're ready to define features
3. Follow the 8-step journey at your own pace
