# 💡 Step 1: Idea Mode

**Days 1-2 of your journey**

Before you write a single line of code, you need to answer one question: **What problem are you solving?**

Idea mode helps you find, validate, and refine a problem worth building a solution for.

## Purpose

In Idea mode, 1M Code acts as a **product coach**. It will:

- Help you brainstorm problems you could solve
- Challenge assumptions about your ideas
- Guide you through customer discovery
- Ensure you're building something people actually want

## When to Use This Mode

Use Idea mode when:

- You're starting from scratch and don't have an idea yet
- You have a vague idea but need to refine it
- You want to validate an existing idea
- You're not sure if your problem is worth solving

## Available Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `read` | Read files in your project |
| `browser` | Search the web for market research |
| `edit` | Create markdown files (notes, ideas) |

Note: Idea mode has limited tools intentionally. You're thinking, not building yet.

## Example Prompts

### Finding an Idea

```
I want to build something but I don't have an idea yet. 
I'm interested in fitness and I'm a college student. 
What problems could I solve?
```

### Validating an Idea

```
I want to build an app that helps people track their water intake. 
Is this a good idea? What questions should I be asking?
```

### Refining an Idea

```
I think my target user is "everyone who wants to drink more water."
Help me narrow this down to a specific user I should focus on.
```

### Competitive Research

```
What apps already exist for tracking water intake? 
What could I do differently?
```

## The Idea Validation Framework

1M Code will guide you through these questions:

### 1. The Problem
- What specific problem are you solving?
- Who has this problem?
- How painful is this problem? (Is it a painkiller or a vitamin?)

### 2. The User
- Who specifically would use this?
- Can you describe them in detail?
- Where do they hang out online?

### 3. The Competition
- What solutions already exist?
- Why haven't they solved the problem?
- What could you do differently?

### 4. The Scope
- What's the simplest version that could work?
- What features are essential vs. nice-to-have?
- Can you build this in 2 weeks?

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: "I'll build it for everyone"
**Problem:** If everyone is your user, no one is your user.
**Fix:** Pick ONE specific person. "College students who forget to drink water during study sessions."

### Mistake 2: "I'll add that feature later"
**Problem:** Scope creep kills projects.
**Fix:** Ruthlessly cut features. Build the smallest possible thing first.

### Mistake 3: "I know what users want"
**Problem:** Assumption-based building leads to products no one uses.
**Fix:** Talk to at least 3 potential users before deciding what to build.

### Mistake 4: "My idea is completely original"
**Problem:** It probably isn't, and that's okay.
**Fix:** Study existing solutions. Do better in ONE specific way.

## Output of This Phase

By the end of Idea mode, you should have:

1. **A clear problem statement** (1 sentence)
2. **A specific target user** (1 paragraph)
3. **Your unique angle** (1 sentence)
4. **A scope decision** (what you will and won't build)

Example:

> **Problem:** College students forget to drink water during long study sessions, leading to headaches and reduced focus.
>
> **User:** Sarah is a sophomore pre-med student who studies 4-6 hours at a time. She knows she should drink more water but forgets when she's focused.
>
> **Angle:** Unlike complex health apps, this is just a simple timer that reminds her to take a sip. No calorie tracking, no social features, no gamification.
>
> **Scope:** Timer + reminder notification + daily log. That's it.

## When to Move On

You're ready for **📝 Spec** mode when:

- ✅ You can describe the problem in one sentence
- ✅ You can describe your target user specifically
- ✅ You've talked to at least one potential user (even casually)
- ✅ You know what you WON'T build
- ✅ You believe you can build something useful in 2 weeks

## Switching to Spec Mode

When you're ready, switch to Spec mode:

**Slash command:** `/spec`

**Or say:** "I've validated my idea. Let's move to defining the product specification."
