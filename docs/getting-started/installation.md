# Installing OneMillion Code

OneMillion Code works with **VS Code** and **Cursor**. This guide will have you up and running in under 2 minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **VS Code** or **Cursor** installed on your computer
  - [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - [Download Cursor](https://cursor.sh/)
- A **OneMillion account** (you'll create one during setup if you don't have one)

That's it. No other software, no terminal commands, no configuration files.

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Open VS Code or Cursor

Launch your editor. If this is your first time using it, that's okay—we'll guide you through everything.

### Step 2: Open the Extensions Panel

There are two ways to open the Extensions panel:

**Option A: Keyboard Shortcut**
| Operating System | Shortcut |
|------------------|----------|
| macOS | `⌘ + Shift + X` |
| Windows/Linux | `Ctrl + Shift + X` |

**Option B: Click the Extensions Icon**

Look for the square icon with four squares in the left sidebar (Activity Bar). Click it.

### Step 3: Search for OneMillion Code

In the search box at the top of the Extensions panel, type:

```
OneMillion Code
```

### Step 4: Install the Extension

1. Find **OneMillion Code** in the search results
2. Click the blue **Install** button
3. Wait a few seconds for the installation to complete

### Step 5: Open OneMillion Code

After installation, you'll see a new icon in your Activity Bar—the **Builder Blocks** logo (a pyramid of stacked blocks).

Click it to open the OneMillion Code panel.
