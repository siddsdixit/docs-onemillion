# Crew & Captains

Building is hard. Building alone is harder. That's why OneMillion organizes builders into **Crews** led by experienced **Captains**.

## What is a Crew?

A Crew is a group of 8-12 builders going through the 2.5-week Ship Cycle together. Your Crew is your support system:

- **Accountability** — People counting on you to ship
- **Support** — Others facing the same challenges
- **Community** — Connections that last beyond the cohort
- **Motivation** — Celebrating wins together

## Your Crewmates

Your Crew will include people with:
- Different backgrounds
- Different project ideas
- Different experience levels
- The same goal: **ship something real**

You'll communicate through:
- Discord channels (primary)
- Weekly check-ins
- Pair building sessions (optional)
- Demo days

## What is a Captain?

Captains are OneMillion alumni who have shipped products themselves. They volunteer to guide new builders through the journey.

### What Captains Do

| Role | How They Help |
|------|---------------|
| **Guide** | Navigate the 8-step journey |
| **Unblock** | Help when you're stuck |
| **Motivate** | Keep energy high |
| **Verify** | Confirm your product ships |
| **Connect** | Introduce you to resources |

### What Captains Don't Do

- ❌ Write code for you
- ❌ Make decisions for you
- ❌ Guarantee success
- ❌ Provide 24/7 support

Captains coach and guide. You do the work.

## Working With Your Crew

### Daily Check-ins

Many Crews do async daily check-ins:
- What did you work on yesterday?
- What are you working on today?
- What's blocking you?

### Weekly Syncs

Your Captain will schedule weekly calls to:
- Review progress
- Troubleshoot blockers
- Plan the next phase
- Keep morale high

### Demo Days

At the end of the journey, you'll demo your product to:
- Your Crewmates
- Your Captain
- (Optional) The broader OneMillion community

## Crew Communication

### Discord

Your Crew has a private Discord channel. Use it for:
- Asking questions
- Sharing progress
- Celebrating wins
- Requesting help

### Best Practices

1. **Be active** — Check in daily, even briefly
2. **Be helpful** — If you can answer someone's question, do it
3. **Be honest** — Share struggles, not just wins
4. **Be supportive** — Celebrate others' progress
5. **Be present** — Show up for scheduled calls

### When to Ask Your Crew

- "Has anyone solved [X problem] before?"
- "I'm stuck on [Y]. Any ideas?"
- "Can someone test my app and give feedback?"

### When to Ask Your Captain

- "I've been blocked for 2+ days on [X]"
- "I'm considering changing my project idea"
- "I'm falling behind the timeline"
- "I have a personal situation affecting my progress"

## Cohort Timeline

Most cohorts follow this structure:

| Week | Focus | Key Events |
|------|-------|------------|
| **Week 0** | Onboarding | Intro call, setup |
| **Week 1** | Think + Start | Idea → Plan → Build begins |
| **Week 2** | Build + Refine | Build → Test → Guard |
| **Week 3** | Ship + Grow | Ship → Sell → Demo Day |

## Getting the Most from Your Crew

### Do

- ✅ Show up consistently
- ✅ Share your work-in-progress
- ✅ Ask for feedback early
- ✅ Celebrate others' wins
- ✅ Be honest about struggles

### Don't

- ❌ Go silent for days
- ❌ Wait until you're "ready" to share
- ❌ Compare yourself negatively
- ❌ Skip scheduled calls
- ❌ Work in isolation

## After the Cohort

Your Crew bonds often last beyond the 2.5 weeks:

- **Alumni Network** — Stay connected in The Dock
- **Future Collaboration** — Build together
- **Mutual Support** — Continue helping each other
- **Lifelong Connections** — Some Crews become friends

## Becoming a Captain

After you ship, you can give back by becoming a Captain:

1. **Ship your product** — Complete the journey first
2. **Express interest** — Let your Captain know
3. **Train** — Learn the Captain framework
4. **Lead** — Guide your first Crew

Captains typically guide 2-3 Crews (25-35 builders) per cohort.
