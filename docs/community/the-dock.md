# The Dock

Welcome to **The Dock** — the community of OneMillion builders who have shipped.

## What is The Dock?

The Dock is the alumni network of everyone who has completed the Ship Cycle and received their Builder Number. It's where builders continue to:

- Connect with other builders
- Share opportunities
- Learn from each other
- Collaborate on new projects
- Give back to future cohorts

## Joining The Dock

You become a member of The Dock when:

1. ✅ You complete the 2.5-week Ship Cycle
2. ✅ Your product is verified as live
3. ✅ You receive your Builder Number

Your Builder Number (e.g., #000042) is your permanent membership credential.
